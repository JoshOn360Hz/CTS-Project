# Escape Room Puzzle System

## How It Works
This project creates a physical escape room puzzle where players interact with an Arduino-controlled **keycard door system**.

1. **Card Swipe Simulation**  
   Players "swipe" a 3D printed card that presses a hidden button.

2. **Access Attempt and Error Code**  
   The Arduino checks for a correct code or card input.  
   If correct, instead of opening the door directly, an **error code** is displayed on the **16x2 LCD screen**.

3. **Troubleshooting Mechanism**  
   Players must find a physical **manual** in the room that explains the error code.  
   This manual provides **wiring instructions** for fixing the door mechanism.

4. **Physical Wiring Puzzle**  
   Players use clues to connect the **stepper motor** or **short specific Arduino pins**, retracting the bolt and unlocking the door.

The system combines digital and physical challenges to create an immersive escape room experience.
